**Features of the Lightweight Wearable Fall Detection System**

**Real-Time Fall Detection**:Utilizes advanced MEMS and force sensors to continuously monitor movement and detect falls accurately.

**Automated Emergency Alerts**:Automatically sends SMS alerts to caregivers or family members upon detecting a fall, ensuring timely assistance.

**GPS Location Tracking**:Integrates a GPS module to provide real-time location data, allowing caregivers to quickly locate the user in case of an emergency.

**Audible and Visual Feedback**:Features a buzzer for immediate audible alerts and a red LED indicator to visually signal the system's status.

**Lightweight and Comfortable Design**:Designed to be compact and non-intrusive, making it easy for elderly individuals to wear comfortably for extended periods.

**Minimized False Alarms**:Employs a combination of sensors and advanced algorithms to differentiate between normal activities and actual falls, reducing unnecessary
alerts.

**User -Friendly Interface**:An LCD display provides real-time updates on system status and sensor readings, enhancing user interaction.

**Continuous Monitoring**:The system resets after an alert and continues to monitor for future falls, ensuring ongoing safety.
