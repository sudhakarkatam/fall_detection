Features of the Lightweight Wearable Fall Detection System

Real-Time Fall Detection:Utilizes advanced MEMS and force sensors to continuously monitor movement and detect falls accurately.

Automated Emergency Alerts:Automatically sends SMS alerts to caregivers or family members upon detecting a fall, ensuring timely assistance.

GPS Location Tracking:Integrates a GPS module to provide real-time location data, allowing caregivers to quickly locate the user in case of an emergency.

Audible and Visual Feedback:Features a buzzer for immediate audible alerts and a red LED indicator to visually signal the system's status.

Lightweight and Comfortable Design:Designed to be compact and non-intrusive, making it easy for elderly individuals to wear comfortably for extended periods.

Minimized False Alarms:Employs a combination of sensors and advanced algorithms to differentiate between normal activities and actual falls, reducing unnecessary
alerts.

User -Friendly Interface:An LCD display provides real-time updates on system status and sensor readings, enhancing user interaction.

Continuous Monitoring:The system resets after an alert and continues to monitor for future falls, ensuring ongoing safety.
